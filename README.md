# Goal

#### - Build a better, lightweight gunshot detection model
#### - Run it on a RaspberryPi
#### - Only classify recordings using deep learning once a more efficient algorithm that runs 24/7 detects acoustic features similar to a gunshot
#### - Implement cross-device communication to map three sensor predictions to a more precise weighted prediction
#### - Create a real-time gunshot-detection pipeline with an overall higher F1 and lower false-positive rate

'Model' contains data and code used to build the gunshot identification model

'Classification' contains code used for real-time classification
