# Goal

#### - Build a better, lightweight gunshot detection model
#### - Run it on a RaspberryPi
#### - Only process recordings with the CNN once a more efficient algorithm that runs 24/7 detects acoustic features similar to a gunshot
#### - Create real-time gunshot-detection pipeline with an overall higher test-accuracy and lower false-positive rate

'Model' contains data and code used to build the gunshot identification model

'Classification' contains code used for real-time classification
